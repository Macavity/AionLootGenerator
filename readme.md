# Aion Loot Generator

Simple PHP based parsing scripts that parse data received from aiondatabase.com, aion.yg.com and aionarmory.com. 
The loot data is gathered and used to fill a MySQL database.

* Since Aion features monsters with different names but shared loot tables, items are summed up by monsters that have the same name.
* Loot percentages are evenly distributed accross items with the same rarity.

Be aware that the code is at least two years old and was developed with functionality in mind.
